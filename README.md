# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkitago/TextDrop/refs/heads/main/Shared%20(App)/Resources/Icon.png" height="36" valign="bottom"/> TextDrop for Safari Extension

This Safari extension instantly saves selected web text as a text file. Skip copy-pasting and launching text editors—just download with one click. If no text is selected, it auto-detects and saves the main content. A simple tool for efficient workflows.

Originally developed to help bypass token limits when working with generative AI services, this extension creates universal plain text files instead of formatted notes. This gives you complete flexibility to use your captured content with any application, AI service, or text processing tool without format restrictions. Perfect for researchers, developers, students, and everyday users who need web content in the most compatible format for maximum portability and versatility.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Load a web page.
2. Select the text on the web page you wish to save. This step is optional as advanced auto-detection intelligently identifies content types (articles, forum discussions, YouTube transcripts) and extracts the relevant text automatically, saving you from manually selecting complex threaded conversations or lengthy video transcriptions.
3. Click the extension icon next to the address bar, or on macOS, use the "TextDrop" command from the context menu.
4. Depending on your website settings, you may need to approve a file download prompt. Save the text file to your preferred location.

> [!NOTE]
> For certain pages with download restrictions, clicking the extension button will open a new tab with platform-specific behavior:
> 
> **[macOS]**  
> A download permission prompt will appear. Please allow the download immediately, as this tab will automatically close after approximately 5 seconds. You will return to the original tab once it closes.
> 
> **[iOS/iPadOS]**  
> The extracted text will be displayed. Select the text, tap "Share," then choose "Save to Files" from the share menu to save it to your desired location. Additionally, depending on the type of restrictions, the "View" button may not appear in the download prompt due to browser implementation differences.
